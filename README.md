This is the 'README.md' file for the final project of the Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning Data'. In addition to this README file, the project contains 'run_analysis.R',  a script which:

* Downloads and uzips data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
* Loads the training and test data files into R and merges them into one data set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each variable
* Replaces the coded variable names with descriptive variable names
* Creates a tidy data set  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* Outputs the tidy data into a file named 'tidy_data.txt'

This repository also contains a code book describing the data set.
